# The 100 Days of AI

A repository for my adventures with the [100 Days of AI Challenge](https://www.100daysai.com/)

What is the 100 Days of AI you ask? Well, it is free, fun and effective 30-minute bite-sized lessons delivered daily to guide your AI learning journey.

This is where I store the exercises or missions that need a "code" home. Even though the exercises are always AI and or No Code based, sometimes you need a place to store the code that AI-generated (or helped generate) for you, as you see below ðŸ‘‡
